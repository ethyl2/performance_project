## Steps taken to optimize this project:

1. Add `media="print"` to `<link href="css/print.css" rel="stylesheet">`

2. Add `async` to `<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js">`

3. Move the inline script `<script> (function(w,g){w['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=g;` etc. out of the head and into the body.

4. Change style.css content location from `<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">` to inline `<style>`.

5. Eliminate link to fonts: `<link href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel="stylesheet">`
 and its corresponding use in the css:
  `body, button, input, select, textarea { font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; color: #333; }`

  #### Effect:

  The steps above increased the scores to __30__.

6. Change source for 3 images from an external link to my images folder. It might
  not make a big change, but it will be handy to have all my images together for
  later changes to improve optimization.

  becomes `<img src="img/project2048.jpg">`

  becomes `<img src="img/projectmobile.jpg">`

7. Minimize `index.html`.

  #### Effect:

  The steps above increased the score to __93__ for mobile and __95__ for desktop.

8. Resize `pizzeria.jpg` and compressed all of the images.

  #### Effect:

  In this case, it didn't
  make a measurable difference, that is, the scores didn't change, but it is
  good practice to resize and compress images.

## To Improve Performance of Pizza Site:

1. In main.js, in the `changePizzaSizes` function, pull the variables `dx` and `newwidth`
  out of the loop, since their values are the same for all of the generated pizza
  images. Inside, calculate those values once, for `document.querySelectorAll(".randomPizzaContainer")[0]` and then start the loop.

  #### Before the change:

  __95.0 ms__ when sliding from Med -> Small.

  __101.8 ms__ when sliding from Small -> Large.

  #### After the change:

  __5.9 ms__ when sliding from Med -> Small.

  __10.3 ms__ when sliding from Small -> Large.

2. In main.js, in `updatePositions()`, take the following calculation out of the loop.
  Calculate it once instead and assign it a variable.

  `var phaseScroll = document.body.scrollTop / 1250;`

  Then use that variable to calculate the phase variable:

  `var phase = Math.sin(phaseScroll + (i % 5));`

  #### Before the change:

  Ave. scripting time to generate last 10 frames: __24.39 - 29.46 ms__ .

  #### After the change:

  Ave. scripting time to generate last 10 frames: __4.42 ms__ .

3. In `updatePositions()`, use `getElementsByClassName` instead of
  `querySelectorAll` because the former is faster. Here's an article that
  explains why:
  https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/09/28/why-is-getelementsbytagname-faster-that-queryselectorall/.
  Basically, the object returned by gEBCN is a Live `NodeList` object, which can
  be created and returned faster by the browser, because they donâ€™t have to have
  all of the information up front. Static `NodeLists` (which result from
  `querySelectorAll`) need to have all of their data from the start.

  `var items = document.querySelectorAll('.mover');`

  becomes

  `var items = document.getElementsByClassName('mover');`

  #### Effect:

  The ave. scripting time to generate last 10 frames decreased to __1.7 - 1.9 ms__ .

4. In `updatePositions()`, pull another calculation out of the loop.
  Because phase calculation is dependent on modulo, all the values returned will be
  only 5 values, between sin(phaseScroll + 0) and sin(phaseScroll + 4).
  Before the loop starts, have the values calculated and inserted into a `phaseArray`
  array.

  ```
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    phaseArray[i] = Math.sin(phaseScroll + i);
  }
  ```

  And then use `phaseArray` inside the main loop:

  `var phase = phaseArray[i % 5];`

  #### Effect:

  The ave. scripting time decreased by about __0.1 ms__, with a range of __1.3
  - 1.6 ms__ .

5. In `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function()`, decrease the
  amount of generated animated pizzas from 200 to 50. Even with zooming out the
  page, only 25 pizzas show on the page at a time, so 200 seems unnecessary.
  Even 50 might be more than needed, but should be a good amount, just in case.

  Change the upper limit for `i`:

  `for (var i = 0; i < 50; i++)`

  #### Effect:

  The ave. scripting time decreased to about __0.5 ms__.

6. Back in `changePizzaSizes()`, change all `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`
  to `getElementById` and `getElementsByClassName`.

  The time differences I measured:

  #### Before the change:

  __12.3 ms__ when sliding from Medium -> Small.

  __8.1 ms__ when sliding from Small -> Large.

  #### After the change:

  __2.8 ms__ when sliding from Medium -> Small.

  __1.7 ms__ when sliding from Small -> Large.

7. Also, in `changePizzaSizes()`, add the variable `containers`, since its value
  is used several times in the function.

  `var containers = document.getElementsByClassName("randomPizzaContainer");`

  #### Effect:

  The times decreased by about __0.1 ms__.

8. Inside the scroll event listener, put the `updatePositions` function inside a
  `requestAnimationFrame()`.

  `window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
      window.requestAnimationFrame(updatePositions);
  });`

  #### Effect:

  This didn't really make a noticeable effect on the timing, but it is considered
  good coding practice, since `updatePositions()` creates a visible change to the
  page.
