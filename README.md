# Website Performance Optimization Portfolio Project

The challenge for this project was to optimize this online portfolio for speed.
This website had optimization and performance-related issues. By applying the
techniques from the
[Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884),
we needed to optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as
quickly as possible.

#### The goals:

1.  Have `index.html` achieve a target `PageSpeed` score of at least 90 for
  Mobile and Desktop.

2. Have `views/main.html` run at least 60 frames per second.

3. Have the time to resize pizzas be less than 5 ms using the pizza size slider
  on the `views/pizza.html` page. Resize time is shown in the browser developer tools.

### Getting started

#### Live

Point your browser to https://ethyl2.github.io/performance-project

#### Locally

1. Check out the repository:

  ```bash
  $> git clone https://github.com/ethyl2/performance_project
  ````

2. You can run a local server:

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

  Open a browser and visit localhost:8080.

  Alternatively:

  ```bash
  $> open "http://localhost:8080"
  ```

3. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

4. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights.

#### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
